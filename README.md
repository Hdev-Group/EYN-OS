# EYN-OS

It's here. Well, a bit of it at least.

It's mostly unfinished, but there's a kernel and it can print to the screen using C. Basically, you can now add C code to the OS to make it do what you want, all the hard work is done.

### To build:
---

To build it, you just need to change to the EYN-OS directory and type 'make build-x86_64'. Then, run the 'kernel.iso' in '/dist/x86/' with QEMU to boot the OS in a virtual machine.
